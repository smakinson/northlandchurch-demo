Baptism is an outward expression of our inward faith, a declaration to the world that we've chosen to follow Jesus Christ... a washing away of the old life, committing ourselves completely as followers of Jesus Christ. It's an instruction given to us by Jesus in Matthew 28, and even Jesus Himself was baptized. 

If you have never been baptized before this is your chance to take this step of obedience in Christ! If you have recommitted yourself to following Christ and desire to make a public statement of that through baptism, you are also welcome. Be sure to invite your friends and family to celebrate with you!
